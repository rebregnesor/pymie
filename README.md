# PyMie

A simple implementation of the mie solution to Maxwell's equations in python.

I was looking for a code that could simply and quickly give me access to the near-field around a spherical particle.
The code tries to achieve exactly that. It was not optimized for speed but still runs reasonably fast.

Just try it out by running the python script Mie.py. If everything works as intended, you should get an animation of the near-field.


Use at your own risk, I can not guarantee correctness.
